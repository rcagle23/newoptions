## new_options: a test app to understand the rails new command line tool and its options

I used the --skip-git option when creating this new app, which skips the .gitignore file. A .gitignore file is a file that lets Git know which files to skip when making a commit. I believe the --skip-git option makes it so that any gitignore file created would not be shared with others in the respository, but I'm not sure about this. 

Made for the Basic Rails app assignment at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).
